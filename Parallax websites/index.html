        What is a Parallax Website?
        A Parallax Website is a type of website where the background moves at a slower speed than the foreground while scrolling, <br>creating a 3D depth effect. This technique makes websites more visually appealing and interactive.
        
        üìå Key Characteristics:
        ‚úÖ Background moves slower than foreground (depth effect).
        ‚úÖ Smooth scrolling animations and transitions.
        ‚úÖ Engaging and immersive user experience.
        ‚úÖ Often used for storytelling, portfolios, and product showcases.

      <p>
        üìå How Parallax Works
The parallax effect is achieved using:

CSS (background-attachment: fixed;) ‚Äì Fixes the background while scrolling.
JavaScript (window.scrollY) ‚Äì Moves elements dynamically based on scroll position.
Libraries (GSAP, Locomotive Scroll, ScrollMagic) ‚Äì For smooth animations and advanced effects.
üìå Examples of Parallax Websites
1Ô∏è‚É£ Nike Better World ‚Äì Uses smooth scrolling with parallax effects.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Apple Product Pages ‚Äì Showcases products with depth and animation.
3Ô∏è‚É£ NASA Prospect ‚Äì Uses storytelling with a space theme.
